# Discord transparent blurry wallpaper

This is a very simple user stylesheet to apply a blurry wallpaper to Discord in a transparent fashion.

You can use the addon "Stylus" to apply it on Discord in a browser, but I haven't tested it on Discord on the desktop with something like BetterDiscord, so your mileage may vary.
